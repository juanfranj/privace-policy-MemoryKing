        </ol>

        <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>

        <p>Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence, including the United States, where Google's servers are located. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country.</p>

        <p><strong>Safeguards for international transfers:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>EU-US Data Privacy Framework:</strong> Google is certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework for transfers from the EEA to the US.</li>

            <li><strong>Adequate safeguards:</strong> Google implements technical and organizational measures to ensure data is protected in accordance with international standards.</li>

        <h2>10. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>

        <p><strong>MemoryKing itself does not use cookies.</strong> However, third-party services we use (AdMob and Firebase) may use cookies and similar tracking technologies:</p>

        <h3>10.1 Types of Tracking Technologies Used</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>First-party identifiers:</strong> Firebase generates anonymous app instance IDs to track app sessions and analytics.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-party cookies:</strong> AdMob and its advertising partners may set cookies to serve personalized ads and measure ad performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Device identifiers:</strong> Android Advertising ID (AAID) is used by AdMob for advertising purposes. This is a unique, user-resettable identifier.</li>
            <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> Firebase may use local storage on your device to cache data and improve performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>10.2 How to Manage Tracking</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Opt out of personalized ads:</strong> Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Opt out of Ads Personalization (this limits cookie-based ad tracking)</li>
            <li><strong>Reset Advertising ID:</strong> Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Reset advertising ID (this resets all ad tracking)</li>
            <li><strong>Clear app data:</strong> Settings &gt; Apps &gt; MemoryKing &gt; Storage &gt; Clear Data (this removes all local tracking)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. Do Not Sell My Personal Information (CCPA)</h2>

        <p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have the right to opt out of the "sale" of personal information.</p>

        <p><strong>Does MemoryKing "sell" personal information?</strong></p>
        <p>We do not directly sell your personal information to third parties for money. However, under CCPA's broad definition, AdMob's sharing of device identifiers and usage data with advertising partners to serve personalized ads may be considered a "sale."</p>

        <p><strong>How to opt out:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your Android device <strong>Settings</strong></li>
            <li>Go to <strong>Google</strong> &gt; <strong>Ads</strong></li>
            <li>Enable <strong>"Opt out of Ads Personalization"</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Alternatively, you can contact us at [YOUR EMAIL] with the subject line <strong>"CCPA Opt-Out Request"</strong> and we will assist you in opting out of data sharing with AdMob's advertising partners.</p>

        <p><strong>Effect of opting out:</strong> You will still see ads in the app, but they will not be personalized based on your device identifier or usage patterns.</p>

        <h2>12. Third-Party Links</h2>

        <p>MemoryKing does not contain direct links to third-party websites or services. However, advertisements displayed through Google AdMob may contain links to external websites, apps, or services.</p>

        <p><strong>Important:</strong> We are not responsible for the privacy practices, content, or security of these third-party sites. These sites operate independently and have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any third-party site you visit through ad links.</p>

        <p>If you click on an ad and are taken to an external site, that site may collect information about you according to its own privacy policy, which may differ significantly from ours.</p>

        <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons.</p>

        <p><strong>How we notify you of changes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Minor changes:</strong> We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy and post the new policy on this page.</li>
            <li><strong>Material changes:</strong> For significant changes that affect your rights or how we use your data, we will display a prominent notice within the app before the changes take effect and/or send a notification if we have a way to contact you.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Your continued use of MemoryKing after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</strong> If you do not agree with the changes, please stop using the app and uninstall it from your device.</p>

        <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.</p>
